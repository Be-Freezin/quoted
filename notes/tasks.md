    Project Setup:
        Set up a new Next.js project.
        Configure Firebase for authentication, database (Firestore), and storage.

    User Authentication:
        Implement user registration functionality, allowing users to create accounts.
        Enable user login functionality to authenticate users.
        Implement password reset functionality (optional).

    User Profile Management:
        Create user profile pages where users can edit their basic information.
        Implement the ability for users to upload and update their profile pictures.

    Quote Creation and Management:
        Design a form for users to submit quotes, including fields for the quote text, author name, and optional profile picture upload.
        Store each quote entry in the Firestore database, including the timestamp.

    Homepage and Quote Listing:
        Create a homepage that displays all quotes in descending order of their timestamp.
        Fetch and render the quotes from the Firestore database.
        Display the author's name, profile picture (or a placeholder), and the creation timestamp for each quote.

    Authentication Restriction and Authorization:
        Implement authentication checks to ensure that only logged-in users can access the app's features.
        Add logic to allow only the author of a quote to edit or delete it.

    Testing and Refinement:
        Test the application thoroughly, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
        Gather feedback, identify and fix any bugs or usability issues.

    Deployment and Continuous Integration:
        Deploy the Next.js application to a hosting provider.
        Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for seamless updates.
